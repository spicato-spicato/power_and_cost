# Power and Cost — Player Guide

A Minecraft Fabric mod that reworks the anvil economy to make enchanting and repairing feel more balanced and predictable.

---

## Overview

**Power and Cost** changes how the anvil works. Instead of the vanilla system where costs spiral out of control and heavily enchanted items become "Too Expensive," this mod uses a **power level** system. Every item and enchantment has a power value, and those values drive both XP costs and how much durability you get when repairing.

**What you’ll notice in-game:**

- **No more "Too Expensive"** — You can always combine or enchant items, even very powerful ones. Costs cap at a predictable maximum (around 50 levels).
- **Repair costs stay simple** — Repairing with materials always costs **1 material + 1 XP level**, regardless of tier.
- **Heavily enchanted gear repairs less** — The more enchantments you have, the less durability each repair restores. Endgame gear is still repairable, but you’ll use more materials.
- **Early enchants stay cheap** — Adding a few enchantments to a new item costs only a few levels. Costs ramp up as your item gets more powerful.
- **Table XP follows power** — Bookshelves still decide which enchantments appear. The levels you pay scale with the item’s material power plus the power of that button’s offers (same curve as anvil book-apply). Lapis stays 1 / 2 / 3.

## How It Works

### Power Level

Every item has a **power level** made from two parts:

1. **Material power** — Based on the item’s tier (wood, stone, iron, diamond, netherite, etc.).
2. **Enchantment power** — Each enchantment adds power based on its type and level.

Higher power means higher XP costs for enchanting/combining (anvil and table), and lower repair effectiveness for durability.

## Enchanting Table

The table still works like vanilla for **what** you can roll: bookshelf count, item enchantability, and treasure rules are unchanged. You still need lapis (1, 2, or 3) and enough player levels to click a button.

**What changes:** the XP level cost on each of the three buttons is no longer “bookshelf level 1–30.” It uses the same power-level sigmoid as putting a book on an anvil:

| Aspect | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **What appears** | Vanilla (bookshelves + item type) |
| **Lapis** | Vanilla (1 / 2 / 3) |
| **XP cost** | Combined power of the item **plus** the enchantments that button would apply |
| **Cost range** | Same as anvil enchanting: about **1 level** (minimum) to **50 levels** (maximum) |

**Cost behavior:**

- **Low-power items** (wood, stone, a regular book) — first rolls stay cheap.
- **High-material items** (diamond, netherite) — the same roll costs more than on wood, because material power counts.
- **Stronger rolls** — a button that would apply more or stronger enchantments costs more than a weak roll on the same item.
- **Books** — a book has no material power, so you mostly pay for the enchantment(s) offered.

You still need enough player levels for that slot’s **vanilla bookshelf power** (the number on the right — a 15-shelf table still unlocks the top row around 30). The **left orb** and the tooltip’s “Enchantment Levels” line are the XP you pay. Lapis stays 1 / 2 / 3. Take the item out and put it back (or wait a moment) after adding shelves so offers refresh. The table does not enchant already-enchanted gear.

## Anvil Operations

### Renaming

Renaming an item costs **1 level**, same as vanilla. No changes.

---

### Repairing (Item + Material)

When you repair an item with its repair material (e.g., iron ingots for iron tools):

| Aspect | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **XP cost** | Always **1 level** |
| **Material cost** | Always **1 material** (e.g., 1 iron ingot) |
| **Durability restored** | Depends on your **enchantments only** — not the material tier |

**Repair effectiveness:**

- **Unenchanted or lightly enchanted** — You get about the same or slightly more durability than vanilla per repair.
- **Moderately enchanted** — Durability per repair starts to drop.
- **Heavily enchanted (god-tier gear)** — Each repair restores about one-third of what vanilla would. You can still repair, but you’ll need more materials.

The material tier (wood vs netherite) does **not** affect repair effectiveness. Only enchantments matter.

---

### Enchanting (Item + Enchanted Book)

When you add an enchantment from a book to an item:

| Aspect | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **XP cost** | Based on the **combined power** of the resulting item (material + all enchantments). |
| **Cost range** | Roughly **1 level** (minimum) to **50 levels** (maximum). |

**Cost behavior:**

- **Low-power items** — Adding your first few enchantments costs around 3–5 levels.
- **Mid-power items** — Costs increase as you add more or stronger enchantments.
- **High-power items** — Costs approach the cap of about 50 levels. No more "Too Expensive."

---

### Combining (Item + Same Item)

When you combine two items of the same type (e.g., two diamond swords):

| Aspect | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **XP cost** | Same formula as enchanting — based on the **combined power** of the result. |
| **Durability restored** | Same logic as repair — based on the **left item’s enchantments**. |

You get both effects in one operation: enchantments from the right item are merged into the left, and durability is transferred from the right to the left, scaled by the repair factor.

## Material Power Values (Reference)

Approximate power values by tier:

| Tier | Power |
|------|-------|
| Wood / Leather | 10 |
| Stone / Chainmail | 20 |
| Copper | 25 |
| Gold | 30 |
| Iron | 40 |
| Diamond | 70 |
| Netherite | 100 |

**Special items:** Bow (70), Crossbow (40), Trident (45), Elytra (55), Shield (40), Fishing Rod (20), etc.

---

## Enchantment Power (Reference)

Enchantments add power per level. Higher values mean the enchantment contributes more to costs and repair penalties.

| Enchantment | Power per level |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Sharpness, Power, Fortune, Protection | 14 |
| Smite, Bane of Arthropods, Breach, Density, Impaling, Silk Touch | 12 |
| Efficiency, Looting | 10 |
| Unbreaking, Fire Aspect, Sweeping Edge, Flame, Punch, and most armor/utility enchants | 8 |
| Knockback, Aqua Affinity, Channeling, Wind Burst, Mending, Infinity, Curses, Soul Speed, Swift Sneak | 4 |

## Design Philosophy

- **Encourages high-level enchants** — Putting strong enchantments on items early is efficient. Costs scale with total power, so building up gradually is more expensive than going for strong enchants from the start.
- **Discourages "god-tier stacking"** — Combining many low-level enchants into one super-item is costly. The system favors focused, powerful builds.
- **Repair stays viable** — Heavily enchanted gear never becomes unrepairable. You’ll use more materials, but you can always maintain your gear.
- **Predictable caps** — XP costs top out around 50 levels. No more hitting an invisible wall at 40.
